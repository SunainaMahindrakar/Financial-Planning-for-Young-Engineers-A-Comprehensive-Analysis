# Financial-Planning-for-Young-Engineers-A-Comprehensive-Analysis
This repository contains a detailed financial analysis designed for engineers under 30, focusing on budgeting, investment strategies, retirement planning, and housing decisions. The study evaluates various financial scenarios and provides recommendations for long-term financial stability using engineering economy principles.

## Overview
This project explores financial planning tailored for engineers under the age of 30. It includes an analysis of budgeting, investment options, housing decisions, and retirement savings. Using real-world data and engineering economy principles, the study offers actionable recommendations for financial stability.

## Objectives
- Develop a financial plan for a young engineer starting their career.
- Compare renting vs. buying a house.
- Evaluate public transport vs. owning a car.
- Analyze the benefits of investing in stocks.

## Key Highlights
- **Starting Point**: A 25-year-old engineer with $55,000 in savings, a $60,000 education loan, and a $12,000 monthly salary.
- **Investment Scenarios**: Monthly stock investments with 8% annual returns vs. no investment.
- **Housing Decisions**: Renting with annual increases vs. buying with a 35-year mortgage.
- **Transportation Options**: Public transport vs. purchasing a car every 5 years.

## Findings
1. **Investments**: Stocks are beneficial if the Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR) is ≤ 8%.
2. **Housing**: Buying is preferable for MARR ≤ 8%, while renting is better for MARR > 8%.
3. **Transportation**: Public transport is consistently more cost-effective than owning a car.

## Recommendations
- Invest in stocks if the expected return rate is ≤ 8%.
- Opt for public transport over buying a car.
- Choose between renting and buying a house based on the MARR.

## Methodology
Engineering economy principles such as Time Value of Money were applied to:
- Future value calculations of investments.
- Loan repayment schedules.
- Comparative financial modeling for multiple scenarios.
